1. To process a single file
	run_pipeline.m

2. To process a batch of files individually through hpc
	pbs jobscript e.g. run1D.pbs, run1D_fissa.pbs  
    hpc_pipeline_batch.m - function with input arguments array_id and list
    * pbs jobscript generates array_id values and processes all files in list.txt

    Notes:  On hpc, normcorre and CaImAn only work with Matlab R2017a.
            FISSA, in contrast, needs higher versions.
            So hpc_pipeline_batch automatically detects the version running and 
                disregards FISSA when running R2017a even when settings call for it.
