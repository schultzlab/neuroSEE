1. To process a single file
	run_pipeline.m

2. To process a batch of files individually
	a. 1D files without fissa: run1D.pbs is submitted to hpc, calls Matlab R2017a and runs hpc_pipeline_batch1D.m. This script processes all the files listed in list_1D.txt without FISSA correction (because CaImAn does not work in Matlab R2018a and FISSA needs to run in R2018a or higher).
	b. 1D files with fissa: run1D_fissa.pbs is submitted to hpc, calls Matlab R2018a and runs hpc_pipeline_batch1D.m (same script as above) which processes all the files listed in list_1D_fissa.txt. The script automatically detects which version is running and disables fissa when version is R2017a.
	c. 2D files without fissa: run2D.pbs
	d. 2D files with fisssa: run2D_fissa.pbs
